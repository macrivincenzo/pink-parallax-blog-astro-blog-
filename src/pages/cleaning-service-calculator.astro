            <h2>SDE Analysis for Cleaning Services</h2>
            <p>Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) is the most accurate method for <strong>cleaning service valuation</strong>. Unlike traditional businesses, cleaning services have unique financial structures including recurring revenue models, variable labor costs, and owner-operator compensation that require specialized analysis.</p>
            <h3>Cleaning Service SDE Formula</h3>
            <p><strong>SDE = Net Income + Owner's Salary + Benefits + Depreciation + Interest + Non-recurring Expenses + Owner's Personal Expenses</strong></p>

            <h3>Understanding Cleaning Service Cash Flow</h3>
            <p>Cleaning services have unique cash flow characteristics that impact valuation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recurring Revenue:</strong> 60-85% of revenue from regular weekly/bi-weekly clients</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Payment Terms:</strong> Mix of weekly, monthly, and one-time payments</li>
                <li><strong>Labor Intensity:</strong> 50-70% of revenue goes to direct labor costs</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal Variations:</strong> Higher demand in spring, back-to-school, and holiday seasons</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Costs:</strong> 3-8% of revenue for cleaning supplies and equipment</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>What is the average cleaning service valuation in 2025?</h4>
                <p>Cleaning service valuations typically range from $150K to $3M+, with most services valued between $300K and $1.2M. The exact value depends on service type, client mix, recurring revenue percentage, location, and financial performance. Residential services average 2.0x-3.5x SDE, while commercial services can command 2.2x-4.0x SDE multiples.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>How do I calculate SDE for my cleaning service?</h4>
                <p>SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings) = Net Income + Owner's Salary + Benefits + Depreciation + Interest + Non-recurring Expenses + Personal Expenses. For cleaning services, be sure to add back owner's vehicle expenses, personal supplies, owner's health insurance, family members' compensation above market rate, and depreciation on equipment and vehicles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>How important is recurring revenue percentage for valuation?</h4>
                <p>Extremely important. Services with 75%+ recurring revenue (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly contracts) command 25-40% premium valuations. Services with under 50% recurring revenue face valuation discounts. Recurring revenue provides predictable cash flow, reduces marketing costs, and indicates strong client relationships - all critical value drivers.</p>
