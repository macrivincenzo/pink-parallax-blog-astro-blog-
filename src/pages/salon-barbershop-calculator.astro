            <p>The beauty industry is experiencing unprecedented growth, with the global beauty services market valued at over $190 billion in 2025. <strong>Salon and barbershop valuation</strong> requires specialized knowledge of service-based revenue models, client retention patterns, and industry-specific metrics that traditional business valuations often overlook.</p>

                <li><strong>Partnership Negotiations:</strong> Fair valuations for bringing in new stylists or investors</li>
                <li><strong>Franchise Opportunities:</strong> Evaluate franchise purchases or multi-location expansions</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment & Renovation Financing:</strong> Secure loans using your business value as collateral</li>

            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>What is the average salon valuation in 2025?</h4>
                <p>Salon valuations typically range from $150K to $1.5M+, with most beauty businesses valued between $200K and $600K. The exact value depends on business type, location, client base, and financial performance. High-end spas often command higher multiples than traditional salons.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>How is salon valuation different from other businesses?</h4>
                <p>Salon valuations focus heavily on service-based metrics like client retention rates, average service tickets, and chair utilization. The personal service nature, stylist dependencies, and licensing requirements make beauty businesses unique from product-based companies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>What's more important: revenue or profit for salon valuation?</h4>
                <p>While both matter, profitability (SDE) is more critical for valuation. A salon with $300K revenue and $80K SDE is typically worth more than one with $400K revenue and $60K SDE due to better operational efficiency and margins.</p>
