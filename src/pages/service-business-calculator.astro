            <h2>Client Base Analysis for Service Businesses</h2>
            <p>Client base analysis is the most critical factor for <strong>service business valuation</strong>. Unlike product-based businesses, service companies have unique financial structures including recurring revenue from contracts, and project-based revenue from one-time services.</p>
            <h3>Service Business Client Base Formula</h3>
            <p><strong>Company Value = Recurring Revenue √ó Client Multiple + Project Revenue √ó Project Multiple + Tangible Assets</strong></p>

            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>What is the average service business valuation in 2025?</h4>
                <p>Service business valuations typically range from $100K to $10M+, with most companies valued between $300K and $2M. The exact value depends on recurring revenue percentage, client base quality, service specialization, and financial performance. Recurring revenue-heavy services average 3.0x-5.0x SDE, while project-based services can command 2.0x-3.5x SDE multiples.</p>

            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>How is service business valuation different from other businesses?</h4>
                <p>Service business valuations focus heavily on recurring revenue from client relationships, staff expertise, and operational efficiency. The personal service nature, owner/staff dependencies, and client acquisition costs make service businesses unique from product-based companies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 20px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;">
                <h4>What's more important: recurring revenue or profit for service business valuation?</h4>
                <p>Both are important, but recurring revenue is often prioritized. A service business with $800K in recurring revenue and $250K SDE is typically valued higher than one with $1M in project-based revenue and $300K SDE due to the predictability and stability of recurring income. Profitability (SDE) is then applied to this revenue base.</p>
